# Team-3

You need a few environments to run our game. Lucky for you they have been condensed to environment.yml
You can run it on anaconda by first downloading the file, open the location on anaconda, and call this function 
conda env create -f environment.yml
Now that the environment is created, activate it by 
conda activate <pick a name>
