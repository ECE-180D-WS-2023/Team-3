## WElLCOM TO WIZARDING CHESS 
 
### Environments

You need a few environments to run our game. Lucky for you they have been condensed to environment.yml
You can run it on anaconda by first downloading the file, open the location on anaconda, and call this function 

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Now that the environment is created, activate it by 

`conda activate chessenv`

### Starting The Game
There are a few steps to play the online game. 
1) Download out git page
2) In chess_gui, update "self.piece_path" to where you have the images saved within the files downloaded
3) In game_structure, update "engine = chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci" to where you have stockfish saved
4) Open two anaconda windows and open the file that 'chess' is saved under
5) Run chess_gui first then game_structure
6) Now the game will help you learn how to play via the tutorial 


Our current physical board is still under contstruction but we hope you enjoy the online version!
